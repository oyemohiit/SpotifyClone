# SpotifyClone
This is my first Web Development Project in which i have built a fully functional Spotify Web Clone.

This repository contains all the html,css & javascript code also the svgs of the icons i used in the project it also contains some of the songs from the playlist i created, each playlist in the project has the songs you want in it and the cover you want of the playlist which should be named as cover and lastly a json file for each playlist which carries the name and info of the playlist.
*The cover.jpg & info.json file is compulsory for all the playlist you create with the songs you want in it for the project to work properly.*
